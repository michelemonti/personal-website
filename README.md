# Miky Monti Personal Website

A simple, minimalist personal website for Michele "Miky" Monti, showcasing his professional background in digital manufacturing, industrial design, and emerging technologies.

## Overview

This is a static website built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a 3D interactive background using Three.js, multilingual support (7 languages), and a clean, responsive design. No complex frameworks or build tools are used—keeping it intentionally simple and lightweight.

## Technologies

- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** for styling and animations
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and i18n
- **Three.js** for 3D graphics
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting

## Deployment

The site auto-deploys via GitHub Pages. Simply push changes to the `main` branch, and GitHub will handle the rest.

## Local Development

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/michelemonti/personal-website.git
   cd personal-website
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site.
